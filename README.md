Data Visualization is the way of displaying data in a pictorial form. 
It helps transform massive and small datasets into graphics that people can easily comprehend and interpret. 

# Why we need visualization ? 
Visualization helps us solve big problems even with complex sized data. In addition to looking for patterns in the data, it is also known if there are any errors.

# Types

which tells a story to an audience. 


# Benifits
